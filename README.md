# HeyOPCBot
A discord bot for the "Official" HeyOPC Discord Server

It does nothing but shitpost, so I don't know why I did this.....

Throw issues in the issue bin or scream at exsersewo#9883 on the opc discord server. because I don't sleep or something

If you want to run it from your own pc on your own server (though I don't get why you would as it's a private bot) copy quotes.json into the same folder as the executable/dll, then run it after feeding your information into configuration.json.
